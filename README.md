 The project will be divided in 3 sprints
1st sprint (≈19.04-23.04):
Collecting the Dataset
In order to train our machine, we need a huge amount of data so that our model can learn from them by identifying out certain relations and common features related to the objects.
Data Augmentation
Before starting to train our data, we need a lot of data to train upon. Suppose we have a limited number of images for our network. So we need to increase their quaity suppose rotating

2nd sprint (≈23.04-28.04)
Building the CNN and Training our Network
The primary purpose of CNN is to extract features from the input image. Convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data.We need to construct layers upon which we will train our model. Depending on these features we try to classify them.

3rd sprint (≈28.04-3.05)
Testing, fixing bugs, improving
Giving random images and trying to classify them, finding out their accuracy and improving overall project
